# Queue Data Structure

## Overview
A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle. This means that the first element inserted into the queue is the first one to be removed.

## Operations
A queue supports the following operations:

1. **Enqueue (Insertion)** - Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
2. **Dequeue (Removal)** - Removes an element from the front of the queue.
3. **Front (Peek)** - Returns the front element without removing it.
4. **isEmpty** - Checks if the queue is empty.
5. **Size** - Returns the number of elements in the queue.

## Applications of Queue
- **Operating Systems** (Process scheduling)
- **Printers** (Job scheduling)
- **Web Servers** (Request handling)
- **Graph Traversal** (BFS - Breadth-First Search)
