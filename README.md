# Data Structures

## What are Data Structures & Why Are They Important?
Data structures are a way of managing, organizing, and storing data efficiently. They provide a systematic approach to handling and processing data based on specific needs. Choosing the right data structure can significantly improve the performance and efficiency of an application.

## Types of Data Structures
Data structures can be categorized into two types:

### 1. Linear Data Structures (Elements are arranged sequentially)
- **[Array](linear-data-structures/array/README.md)**: A collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations.
- **[Linked List](linear-data-structures/linked-list/README.md)**: A series of connected nodes where each node stores data and a reference to the next node.
- **[Stack](linear-data-structures/stack/README.md)**: A Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure used in function calls, undo operations, etc.
- **[Queue](linear-data-structures/queue/README.md)**: A First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure used in scheduling and buffering.

### 2. Non-Linear Data Structures (Elements are arranged in a hierarchical manner)
- **Tree**: A hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes.
  - Binary Search Tree (BST)
  - AVL Tree
  - Red-Black Tree
  - B-Tree
  - Trie
- **Graph**: A set of nodes (vertices) connected by edges, used in networking and pathfinding algorithms.

## Why Use Data Structures?
- **Efficiency**: Optimizes memory usage and improves performance.
- **Scalability**: Handles large amounts of data efficiently.
- **Ease of Manipulation**: Facilitates operations like searching, sorting, and modifying data.
- **Real-World Applications**: Used in databases, networking, artificial intelligence, operating systems, web development, and more.
